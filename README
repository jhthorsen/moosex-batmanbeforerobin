NAME
    MooseX::InTheRightOrder - Ordered has, with, extends

VERSION
    0.01

DESCRIPTION
    This class will take over some of the exported functions from Moose and
    call them in "the right order".

SYNOPSIS
     package MyClass;
     use MooseX::InTheRightOrder;

     extends ...;
     with ...;
     has ...;

     one; # instead of 1;

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
  extends
    This function will cache all classes which you want to extend your class
    with and then load them before "has()" and "with()" inside "one()".

  has
    This function will cache all attributes which you want to define in your
    class and then define them after "extends()", but before "with()" inside
    "one()".

  with
    This function will cache all roles which you want to do in your class
    and then include them after "extends()" and "has()" inside "one()".

  one
    This function should replace "1;" on the last line in your class. It
    will run "extends", "has()" and "with()" in "the right order". And
    afterwards make the class immutable and clear the namespace, using
    namespace::autoclean.

METHODS
  init_meta
    This method is called on "import()" and sets up namespace::autoclean.
