NAME
    MooseX::InTheRightOrder - Ordered has, with, extends

VERSION
    0.02

DESCRIPTION
    This class will take over some of the exported functions from Moose and
    call them in "the right order":

     1: extends()
     2: has()
     3: with()
     4: override()/augment()
     5: before()/after()/around()

SYNOPSIS
     package MyClass;
     use MooseX::InTheRightOrder;

     extends ...;
     with ...;
     has ...;

     one; # instead of 1;

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS
    See Moose.

  one
    This function should replace "1;" on the last line in your class. It
    will call the Moose keywords in "the right order" and afterwards make
    the class immutable and clear the namespace, using namespace::autoclean.

METHODS
  init_meta
    This method is called on "import()" and sets up namespace::autoclean.
